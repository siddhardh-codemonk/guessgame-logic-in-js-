Number Guessing Game

A simple and fun number guessing web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range, with feedback provided after each attempt.

 Features
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Feedback on guesses (too high / too low / correct)
- Simple, responsive UI with HTML & CSS
- Restart option to play again

Tech Stack
- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling
- **JavaScript** – game logic
At first, I thought about using Python with Flask or FastAPI, but in the end I rewrote the logic in JavaScript to keep it lightweight and fully client‑side.
